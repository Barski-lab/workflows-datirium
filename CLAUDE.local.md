## Workflow Efficiency

- Use modern (cutting-edge) CLI tools for ease (efficient) navigating and files manipulating.
- Always start with pwd /Users/pavb5f/Documents/barskilab-workflows/ - this is your work dir. But only create files for the testing and related in the /Users/pavb5f/Documents/barskilab-workflows/my_local_test_data dir.
