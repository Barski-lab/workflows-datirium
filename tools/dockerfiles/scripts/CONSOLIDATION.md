# DESeq2 LRT Analysis Code Consolidation

## Overview

This document outlines the consolidation of common functions across the DESeq2 LRT analysis workflow (Step 1 and Step 2). The goal was to improve code maintainability, ensure consistency, and optimize memory usage.

## Consolidated Components

### 1. Output Utilities (`common/output_utils.R`)
- Unified output filename generation
- Multi-format plot saving (PNG, PDF, etc.)
- GCT and CLS file creation with data validation
- DESeq2 results export with consistent formatting
- Markdown summary generation
- Output verification for workflow validation
- Interactive MDS plot HTML generation

### 2. Export Functions (`common/export_functions.R`)
- Specialized export functions for DESeq2 results
- GSEA-ready exports (ranked lists, phenotype data)
- Normalized counts export with filtering options
- DESeq2 object persistence and retrieval
- Visualization exports (MDS plots, heatmaps, MA plots)

### 3. Clustering Functions (`common/clustering.R`)
- Memory-efficient HOPACH clustering
- Feature subset selection for large datasets
- Multiple distance metrics with automatic fallback
- Optimized scaling methods (z-score, min-max)

### 4. Utilities (`common/utilities.R`)
- Memory usage tracking and reporting
- Standardized error handling functions
- Parameter validation and type conversion
- File and path utilities (safe mkdir, extension handling)
- Logging with timestamps and categories
- Package management (loading, namespace conflict resolution)

## Key Improvements

### Memory Optimization
- Added memory usage tracking and reporting
- Implemented garbage collection at strategic points
- Limited global data size with configurable thresholds
- Optimized large matrix operations

### Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling with detailed messages
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for clustering
- Added validation for inputs with detailed error reporting
- Created robust path resolution for both Docker and local development

### Code Organization
- Removed redundant function definitions
- Documented function parameters and return values
- Consolidated related functionality
- Added consistent logging throughout
- Merged redundant output functions from multiple files

### Output Management
- Standardized output file naming conventions
- Centralized output verification
- Added consistent metadata inclusion in outputs
- Improved error reporting for output generation

### Docker Compatibility
- Added path resolution for Docker environment
- Updated Dockerfile to include all required packages
- Implemented fallback paths for both Docker and local execution

## Removed or Deprecated Files

The following redundant files were removed or deprecated after consolidation:
- `deseq2_lrt_step_1/export_functions.R`
- `deseq2_lrt_step_1/visualization.R`
- `deseq2_lrt_step_1/metadata_validation.R`
- `deseq2_lrt_step_2/export_functions.R`
- `deseq2_lrt_step_2/visualization.R`
- `deseq2_lrt_step_2/clustering.R`
- `common/output_functions.R` (deprecated in favor of output_utils.R)

## Consolidated Functions Overview

### Output Utilities
- `get_output_filename()`: Generate standardized output filenames
- `save_plot()`: Save plots in multiple formats (PNG, PDF)
- `write_gct_file()`: Write data matrix to GCT format
- `write_cls_file()`: Create CLS files for sample classification
- `write_deseq_results()`: Export DESeq2 results to TSV
- `save_deseq_rds()`: Serialize DESeq2 objects to RDS
- `generate_mds_plot_html()`: Create interactive MDS plots
- `verify_outputs()`: Ensure all required outputs are created

### Utility Functions
- `report_memory_usage()`: Track and log memory consumption
- `with_error_handling()`: Standardized error handling wrapper
- `convert_to_boolean()`: Consistent boolean conversion
- `source_with_fallback()`: Source R files with path resolution
- `log_message()`: Structured logging with levels and categories
- `fix_colnames()`: Clean column names for R compatibility
- `validate_sample_consistency()`: Check sample name consistency

## Testing

A test script (`test_consolidation.R`) has been created to validate the consolidation:
- Verifies that all common functions can be loaded correctly
- Checks that key functions exist and are accessible
- Tests path resolution for both Docker and local environments
- Validates output generation functions

## Future Recommendations

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Create formal unit tests for common functions
2. **Documentation**: Add comprehensive documentation with examples
3. **Configuration**: Make memory thresholds configurable via command line
4. **Parallelization**: Enhance parallel processing capabilities
5. **Progress Reporting**: Add more detailed progress reporting for long-running operations
6. **Modularization**: Further modularize code into logical components
7. **Interactive Dashboard**: Develop an interactive dashboard for visualizing results
