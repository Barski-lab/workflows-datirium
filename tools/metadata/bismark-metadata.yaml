s:about: |
  Bismark is a program to map bisulfite treated sequencing reads to a genome of interest
  and perform methylation calls in a single step. The output can be easily imported into
  a genome viewer, such as SeqMonk, and enables a researcher to analyse the methylation 
  levels of their samples straight away. Bismark is a set of tools for the time-efficient
  analysis of Bisulfite-Seq (BS-Seq) data. Bismark performs alignments of bisulfite-treated
  reads to a reference genome and cytosine methylation calls at the same time. Bismark is
  written in Perl and is run from the command line. Bisulfite-treated reads are mapped using
  the short read aligner Bowtie 2, or alternatively HISAT2.
