  Regulatory Genomics Toolbox  is a python library and set of tools  for the integrative analysis of
  high throughput regulatory genomics data. This library has been used for implementation of several
  tools as ChIP-Seq differential peak callers (ODIN and THOR), DNase-Seq footprinting method (HINT)
  and the visualization tool RGT-Viz. It is implemented in a object oriented fashion in python
  including basic infrastructure for manipulation of genomic data. This project is developed and
  maintained by Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Research Group, RWTH University Hostpital.
