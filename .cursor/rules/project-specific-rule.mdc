Always use --platform linux/amd64 flag when running the Docker container with ARM architecture on my Apple Silicon Mac.
Never create new files until making sure of existing of those already.
At the end of the request always provide a reason chain to critique all just added files / code to remove all the redundant stuff to keep it managable and effective.
Provide a plan with reason for each step. Explain why you have to do so. Critique that. Only after that start implementation.
